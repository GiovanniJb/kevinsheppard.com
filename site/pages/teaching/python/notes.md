# Python Notes 

_**Introduction to Python for Econometrics, Statistics and Numerical Analysis: Fourth+ Edition**_ 

[Download the Notes](#notes)

Python is a widely used general purpose programming language, which
happens to be well suited to econometrics, data analysis and other more
general numeric problems. These notes provide an introduction to Python
for a beginning programmer. They may also be useful for an experienced
Python programmer interested in using NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib and
pandas for numerical and statistical analysis (if this is the case, much
of the beginning can be skipped).

New material added to the fifth edition on September 2021.

## Data and Notebooks

### Data

* [Data and Code](/files/teaching/python/notes/code_from_notes.zip) from the notes. These files are needed to run some of the code in the notes.
* The [Fama-French data set](/files/teaching/python/notes/FamaFrench.zip) is used in the asset-pricing examples.
* The [FTSE 100 data](/files/teaching/python/notes/FTSE_1984_2012.zip) from 1984 until 2012 is used in the GJR-GARCH example.

### Notebooks

These notebooks contains the four extended examples from the Examples chapter.
